1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers
 and returns a new array with only the positive numbers using if, for loop, and push.
Example:
Input: [1, -3, 4, 0, -2] → Output: [1, 4]

2. Given an array of strings, count how many vowels are present in total.
Input: ["apple", "banana", "grape"] → Output: 7

3. Write a program that separates even and odd numbers from an array and stores them in two different arrays.
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output:
Even: [2, 4, 6]
Odd: [1, 3, 5]


4.Write a function to find the second largest number in an array without using built-in sorting.


5. Manually remove duplicates from an array using a loop and indexOf.
Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1] → Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

6.Take an array of numbers and return both the minimum and maximum values without using Math.min/max.


7. Write a function that checks how many strings in an array are palindromes.
Input: ["madam", "apple", "civic", "pop"]
Output: 3

8. Given an array of words, return the longest word and its length.
Input: ["apple", "banana", "grapefruit"] → Output: "grapefruit", 10

9.Take an array of numbers, and return an array of the sum of digits for each number.
Input: [123, 45, 7] → Output: [6, 9, 7]

10. Reverse an array manually without using .reverse().
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4] → Output: [4, 3, 2, 1]
